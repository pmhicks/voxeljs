### Simple JS Voxel Engine

An old school voxel engine in html5. 

Rough port of my java version [https://github.com/pmhicks/voxel]

Should work with most current browsers. Chrome appears to give the best performance and IE11 the worst.


Note: Running from disk using Chrome will give a security error. The page should be hosted to view, e.g. using python in the current directory:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
